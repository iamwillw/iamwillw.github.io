				<p class="portfolio-item-synopsis">To improve customer communication for high priority items, a hero spot was added to the homepage.</p>
				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">For this project, DOL needed a way to highlight major initiatives and projects. Messaging can be setup on a schedule or static. This allows us to schedule messaging at the appropriate time and keeps the homepage fresh. The mobile view shows all the content, except for the image to reduce vertical scrolling.</p>

				<p class="portfolio-item-synopsis">This messaging system allows the Department of Licensing to keep it's customers informed about important changes.</p>
				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">Integrated into the site templates and controlled from a single include file, DOL can quickly and easily post messages to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>a single page</li>
					<li>a section of the site</li>
					<li>the entire site</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">This eliminated the need to update each individual page. PHP coding checks for the current page and if it's a match we show the message. We can also style each message differently and schedule them to start or end on a specific date. With the projects and office moves that have been going on, it's made keeping the public informed much more efficient.</p>

				<a class="portfolio-item-image" href="assets/images/portfolio/dol-schedule-content.jpg"><img src="assets/images/portfolio/dol-schedule-content.jpg" alt ="Scheduling content examples on dol.wa.gov" /></a>
				<p class="portfolio-item-synopsis">Built to make site maintenance easier on the web publisher and the content owner, DOL can schedule content to show or hide on a specific date.</p>
				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">Without a content management system (CMS), managing content can be a little more challenging. Content such as meeting minutes, contract announcements, etc. were manually added and removed. If a content owner forgot to keep track and send a request, or the web publisher hadn't edited the page in some time, older content would remain on the site. Using PHP to check for the current date and the show or hide date, content is automatically handled without intervention. This led to better customer satisfaction and less work for everyone. .</p>

				<p class="portfolio-item-synopsis">Utilizing server-side detection and a new color scheme, this was one of the first WA state government sites to be usable across all devices.</p>
				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">Towards the end of 2013 it we decided that the entire <a href="http://www.dol.wa.gov">dol.wa.gov</a> site needed to be accessible to mobile devices. Within one week I had the site templates updated to use server-side detection to serve all devices. Based on the analytics and testing, phones would get one view and desktop and tablets another. Through the detection script and PHP coding we were now able to send specific assets to the browser. This enabled us to send the smallest payload to the device and ensure our pages loaded quickly. The coding to make the entire site mobile-friendly was completed in 1 week. I launched the mobile-friendly version of the site in January 2014. In 2018 we're hoping to  redo the site as a responsive/server-side detection hybrid making the entire site responsive.</p>

				<p class="portfolio-item-synopsis">Mixing multiple elements to create a "thank you" mini-poster for a co-worker.</p>
				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">We were having some Active Directory (A.D.) issues with our WordPress intranet site and Joe, our resident A.D. expert was able to figure out the right credentials to setup so that our users could login to the site with their network ID and password instead of having to create and remember yet another ID/password combo. I took the poster for the movie and:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Added and modified the old school logo</li>
					<li>Replaced the main character's head with Joe's</li>
					<li>Added additional wording</li>
					<li>Made some subtle color correction</li>

				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">In an effort to improve exposure, I created a video ad for the <a href="http://richardsrecordedmemories.com">store</a> to showcase the kinds of items they sell, their location, and how to contact them. The intent of the video was to post it on their website and social media. I tried to keep it short and to the point while still getting the important details across. Based on the positive feedback we've received from the owner and his customers, I'd say it was a success!</p>

				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">Capitalizing on the zombie craze, they wanted to bring something unique to the local donut market.

				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">Built on top of WordPress with a custom template and coding, the responsive design worked across all devices and had fast load times. This was the 5th iteration of the website. It was originally a static website with some PHP coding for includes, dates, and dynamic content. Eventually it was migrated to WordPress to take advantage of the CMS. This was also the home of Movies Rated "W" a movie-themed podcast, which was also produced by 4D4Films. The site is now offline. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/the4d4films">4D4Films YouTube Channel</a> is still online and has most of their projects available for viewing.</p>

				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">One day, my father-in-law was telling us about "The World's Largest Egg". We were instantly intrigued and decided to go for a drive to find the world-famous egg. With a general idea of where it was, we decided to leave maps and GPS behind and took off in search of the egg. After a few side-trips we found it in Winlock, WA! We shot some footage on our cell phone and took a few pictures and headed home. Once we got home, researched the egg and it's history. While researching the egg, we found a photographer online that had taken some photos in the area. We contacted him about using a few of his pictures in the video and he as happy to contribute to the project!</p>

				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">In 2011, we found mobile visits increasing to <a href="http://www.dol.wa.gov">dol.wa.gov</a> so I set out to create a mobile landing page for our customers. Phone users made up the overwhelming majority so we chose to focus on their experience. We started small with content or online services that were mobile-friendly. For the content I decided on includes so there would be a single source to update. I continued to tweak the design and content as time went on. As 2013 came to a close, it was finally time to make the entire site usable on mobile devices. I retired these pages in January of 2014 when we released the mobile-friendly update to the full site.</p>

Built in classic ASP, I incorporated the TinyMCE editor and separated the content from the page templates. I also coded a printer-friendly option that would conserve ink when printed. We were in talks to update the site and make it fully responsive when the owner decided to sell the cabin.</p>
