				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">While today the focus was inside, it was another great weather day. We've been trying to figure out a way to showcase our Angel of Death prop. Like a Halloween miracle, some inspiration hit and we spent the first part of the day creating a cutout in the club wall for the Angel.

Unfortunately we didn't take any photos of the club walls and roof.</p>
