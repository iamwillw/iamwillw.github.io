				<a class="portfolio-item-image" href="/assets/images/portfolio/4d4films-website.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/portfolio/4d4films-website.jpg" alt ="4D4Films responsive website" /></a>
				<p class="portfolio-item-synopsis">Developed and designed to make it easy to find out about the latest projects, send communications, and buy DVDs and other merchandise.</p>
				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">Built on top of WordPress with a custom template and coding, the responsive design worked across all devices and had fast load times. This was the 5th iteration of the website. It was originally a static website with some PHP coding for includes, dates, and dynamic content. Eventually it was migrated to WordPress to take advantage of the CMS. This was also the home of Movies Rated "W" a movie-themed podcast, which was also produced by 4D4Films. The site is now offline. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/the4d4films">4D4Films YouTube Channel</a> is still online and has most of their projects available for viewing.</p>
				<p class="portfolio-item-keywords">Skills: Coding (WordPress, PHP, HTML, CSS, Responsive), UX and Responsive Design</p>

				<a class="portfolio-item-image" href="/assets/images/portfolio/deep-blue-dvd-case.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/portfolio/deep-blue-dvd-case.jpg" alt ="Deep Blue: A glimpse into Crater Lake DVD cover and label" /></a>
				<p class="portfolio-item-synopsis">This short documentary gives a glimpse inside one of our country's most awe-inspiring displays of nature.</p>
				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">For the 4D4Films project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nca_fgWO80">Deep Blue: A glimpse into Crater Lake</a>, we wanted to showcase the amazing views of the lake. To emphasize the lake, the rest of the caldera is in grayscale. Text sits on top of the image, but I tried to leave as much of the lake visible as possible. This short has been one of our best selling DVDs.</p>

				<p class="portfolio-item-synopsis">Promotional materials designed for the premier party.</p>
				<p class="portfolio-item-summary">When it came time for the premier of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL100089C2582AE1A9">In The Event Of A ZOMBIE ATTACK</a>, 4D4Films needed flyers and tickets for the evening. Artwork from the film helped tie everything together. We partnered with a local business and screened the film in the room they gave classes in during the week. The screening sold out and we ended up having another showing the next day.</p>
